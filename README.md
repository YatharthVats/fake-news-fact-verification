# Fake-news-fact-verification
 
 This is a project created for my NLP class which has been inspired by the FEVER shared task and the fake news challenge. It showcases a small model as to how a claim can be verified by cross checking its authenticity against fact checking articles over the interner. I hope to expand more on this project in the future as well.
